      <p>Howdy!! My name is Spencer Callaway. I am a native Texan and Austinite. I live
         in the northern area of Austin close to Cedar park and Leander. I am also a Texas A&ampM graduate 
         with a degree in plant and environmental soil science.

      <p>After college I couldn't really find a job directly in my degree field without going back to 
        college for an extended period of time. So I worked odd jobs starting with a emergency home 
        restoration company, after that I worked for Life Storage as an assistant manager,
        and now I currently work part time at Twin Liquors while I'm taking web development classes.</p>

      <p> I am a musician and a gamer. I have several instruments and I have been playing for close to 17 years.
         I mostly game on my PC but I also have a few console systems. </p>
